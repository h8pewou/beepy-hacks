Sure, here's a basic `README.md` for your script:

# zoom.sh - Console Font Size Adjuster

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required fonts installed on your system. If you don't have the necessary fonts or encounter any font-related errors, follow the setup instructions provided in [fonts.md](https://github.com/k5njm/beepy-hacks/blob/mainline/fonts.md).

## Usage

To use zoom.sh:

- Copy the script somewhere on your $PATH. I use ~/bin
- Make the script executable: `chmod +x zoom`

- Zoom in (increase font size):
`zoom in`

- Zoom out (decrease font size):
`zoom out`

- Reset font size
`zoom`

For help or more information:
```bash
./zoom -h
```
